    <p style="font-size: 150%;">I worked within a team of four researches to examine land cover change, water quality, land surface temperature and loon nest presence data over twenty years. I acked as the Data Manager by organizing and monitoring all data acquired and created by packaging mpas in ArcGIS Pro and Seadas and pushing to GitHub. I managed a tight schedule to meet all delieverable deadlines, including a technical report and report for non-scientific audiences.
      <br><br>
       My team and I acquired imagery and datasets from Google Earth Engine, Earth Explorer, local governments, and project partners. I identified land surface temperature change trends by developing maps from Landsat and MODIS imagery using JavaScript Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS Pro. My team and I analyzed turbidity of eight case study lakes by processing Landsat and Sentinel imagery and developing maps in Acolite, R Programming, and Seadas. Lastly we analyzed the impact of urban development and proximity of developmen ton loon success in all of New Hampshire and the eight case study lakes using ArcGIS Pro and TerrSet.</p>

      Assessing Land Cover Change and Habitat Connectivity to Inform Management Planning for the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 150%;">I worked within a team of four researchers assessing forest cover change in the past thirty years using Landsat Satellite to support international policy and decision makers. I coordinated between NASA DEVELOP, NASA SERVIR, and international partners by accounting for availability, language differences, and expectations of the project. We presented deliverables to partners and non-geospatial professionals to help inform policy and decision makers.

      My team and I created a forest cover change detection map and performed deforestation time series analysis using Landsat satellites 5, 7, 8, and 9 in ArcGIS Pro. We developed a forest/non forest classification for the entire Mesoamerican Biological Corridor using JavaScript Google Earth Engine.</p>

      Waste Management Habits of Households in Boquete, Panama </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 150%;">Combining my interests about food waste and consumption with enviornmental impacts, I designed a study on waste management habits in households in Boquete, Panama. Due to Panama's foreign tax laws, Boquete has become a popular destination for foreign nationals living abroad which creates a unique divide in the city between Panamanians and foreigners. I interview 40 different households, 20 foreign and 20 Panamanian. The majority of the interviews with the Panamanian households were conducted in Spanish. This research highlighted relationships between global development and household waste management. I found that foreign households were knew of and even currently employ recycling and composting habits within their households, and had preferences towards more environmental friendly waste management solutions. Many Panamanian households didn't practice recycling or composting, and were unfamiliar with more environmentally friendly waste management solutions. This suggested that with global development and access to additional resources, households may practice more diverse and environmentally friendly household waste management solutions.</p>
